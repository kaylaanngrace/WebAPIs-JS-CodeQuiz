# WebAPIs-JS-CodeQuiz

## DESCRIPTION
My motive for this project is to become better at using javascript and webAPIs to develop code. Also in the future I can edit questions for practice tests on other topics. 
## LEARNED/LEARNING
Most of this assignment process, I learned in the previous lesson. I learned how to remove and add class attributes to hide and display differnet "pages". I learned how to set a timer, stop it and save the stopped time in another variable. I learned how to display saved arrays in localStorage on to the page. I also learned that I can have an array within an array and select each part of the array I want to target. I learned how to set values as true/false to create incorrect and correct answers, as well as subtract the time for false values and style them in JS. 
## PROCESS/INSTALLTION
The first thing I did was create my HTML, CSS and JS files. Then I git init to create a repository. Then I layed out my HTML with the three main pages, start/home, questions and answers, and the end page. Then defined the variables and functions, to hide and display each function when needed. Then I set up my timer, which I struggled with, it took alot of refactoring to get it right. Chrome Dev Tools helped me alot with pinpointing errors. After I fixed my timer, I layed out my highscore page and added a home button. Then set up the clearInterval() and saved the timeLeft to the scoreEL. After that I set up the intials to pair with the score and saved them to localStorage. Finally I edited my highscore page to pull the scores and intials from localStorage. Making this quiz was struggle for me but Chrome Dev Tools and google helped alot. 
## USAGE
You have NINETY SECONDS to answer 10 questions. For every WRONG answer FIVE SECONDS will be SUBTRACTED from your current time. Your SCORE will be the TIME LEFT when all questions are answered, if you do not complete the quiz in time you will recieve a score of 0.

Click the answer you think is right, once clicked you cannot change your answer and it will display if it is correct or incorrect. 

At the end of the quiz you can save you score along with your intials.
